Information Retrieval: Comparison tf-idf for classification by kNN and Roccio.

dic. de 2012 – dic. de 2012

Descripción del proyecto
We implemented text classification algorithms using the K nearest neighbors (kNN), the representations used for the documents were weight vectors calculated tf-idf (tf by Term Frequency and idf by Inverse Document Frequency) in the Vector Model and by binary vectors in the Fuzzy Model. The algorithms used to find the similarity between two documents were the Euclidean distance and Cosine angle between the two vectors and additionally the Hamming distance. The project was developed in Java ,using the lucene-core library for indexing documents.
